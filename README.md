## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This challenge is so much fun to do and gave me a lot of new knowledge about what JavaScript can do, such as theme changing from dark theme to light theme and of course the drag and drop feature.

### Continued development

The fact that i still can't find a way to store the task to local storage and get them back still bothering me. So, in the future i would like to learn how to do that.

### Useful resources
